sysbench 0.4.12.10:  multi-threaded system evaluation benchmark

Running the test with following options:
Number of threads: 1
Random number generator seed is 0 and will be ignored


Doing thread subsystem performance test
Thread yields per test: 1000 Locks used: 5
Threads started!
Done.


General statistics:
    total time:                          7.3887s
    total number of events:              10000
    total time taken by event execution: 7.3866
    response time:
         min:                                  0.71ms
         avg:                                  0.74ms
         max:                                  0.87ms
         approx.  95 percentile:               0.75ms

Threads fairness:
    events (avg/stddev):           10000.0000/0.00
    execution time (avg/stddev):   7.3866/0.00
