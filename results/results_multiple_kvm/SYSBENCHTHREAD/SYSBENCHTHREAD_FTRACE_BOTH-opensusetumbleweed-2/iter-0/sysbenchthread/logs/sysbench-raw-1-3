sysbench 0.4.12.10:  multi-threaded system evaluation benchmark

Running the test with following options:
Number of threads: 1
Random number generator seed is 0 and will be ignored


Doing thread subsystem performance test
Thread yields per test: 1000 Locks used: 1
Threads started!
Done.


General statistics:
    total time:                          12.8952s
    total number of events:              10000
    total time taken by event execution: 12.8848
    response time:
         min:                                  0.74ms
         avg:                                  1.29ms
