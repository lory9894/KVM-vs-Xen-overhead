sysbench 0.4.12.10:  multi-threaded system evaluation benchmark

Running the test with following options:
Number of threads: 1
Random number generator seed is 0 and will be ignored


Doing thread subsystem performance test
Thread yields per test: 1000 Locks used: 3
Threads started!
Done.


General statistics:
    total time:                          13.6551s
    total number of events:              10000
    total time taken by event execution: 13.6378
    response time:
         min:                                  0.74ms
         avg:                                  1.36ms

         approx.  95 percentile:               1.66ms

Threads fairness:
    events (avg/stddev):           10000.0000/0.00
    execution time (avg/stddev):   13.6378/0.00
