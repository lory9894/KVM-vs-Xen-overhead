sysbench 0.4.12.10:  multi-threaded system evaluation benchmark

Running the test with following options:
Number of threads: 1
Random number generator seed is 0 and will be ignored


Doing thread subsystem performance test
Thread yields per test: 1000 Locks used: 3
Threads started!
Done.


General statistics:
    total time:                          8.3592s
    total number of events:              10000
    total time taken by event execution: 8.3553
    response time:
         min:                                  0.74ms
         avg:                                  0.84ms
         max:                                 51.17ms
         approx.  95 percentile:               0.99ms

Threads fairness:
    events (avg/stddev):           10000.0000/0.00
    execution time (avg/stddev):   8.3553/0.00
